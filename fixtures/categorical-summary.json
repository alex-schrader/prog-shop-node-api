{
  "Airlines": "The Airlines Category has something for everyone - Democrat supporters (Frontier and United), lots of companies that generally support both parties, and then a few airlines that mostly support Republicans.  It also has a large number of companies with PACs.  Many people are locked in to a certain brand here (due to the success of frequent flyer programs), but if you do have flexibility in your travels, we recommend considering political contributions in your purchases.",
  "Rental Cars": "The rental car industry is very conservative.  We recommend using Uber or Lyft if you can.",
  "Hotel - Economy": "It's easy to shop your values when staying at Economy Hotels.  Just pick one of the Wyndham or Choice brands and you'll be doing just fine.  The only brand to really avoid is Best Western.",
  "Hotel - Extended Stay": "Extended Stay Hotels offer something for everyone.  Your best choice is any of the Choice branded hotels.  Whatever you do, please avoid Extended Stay America.",
  "Hotel - Full Service": "Full Service Hotels are generally very middle of the road in terms of political contributions.  The one exception is Wyndham - we recommend them above the others.",
  "Hotel - Luxury": "Luxury Hotels are generally very bipartisan in their contributions.  IHG is the one exception.  They give more to Democrats - but not by a large margin.",
  "Shipping": "When shipping, the Postal Service is by far your best bet!",
  "General Merchandise": "In the ecommerce category, Etsy and Costco really stick out as the best options.",
  "Bookstores": "Generally the bookstore category is pro-Democrat in their contributions.  There are a couple of small chains to avoid  - but generally you are safe wherever you shop,",
  "Electronics": "Apple really sticks out in this category as the best option to shop your values.",
  "Shoes": "There are some great shoe brands that you can support with confidence - including Toms, Crocs, DSW and Vans.  ",
  "Department Stores": "Department Stores are very regional, and as expected their political contributions generally reflect the part of the country where they are based.  Look at Boscov's, Macy's and Nordstroms as the best options to shop your values.",
  "Pets": "Among major pet brands, PetSmart is your best bet.  You can also see some minor internet only options in our analysis that might be good options for you.",
  "Office Supplies": "Among the major office supply brands, your best bet is Office Depot.  Beyond them there are a number of other good options you can see in the list to the right.",
  "Pharmacies": "Among Pharmacy companies there are no great options.  The best you can do is support a pharmacy that is bipartisan.  Whatever you do - please avoid Rite Aid and Kroger - they are especially against progressive causes.\n\nIt turns out that employees among these companies are much more sympathetic to progressive causes - with CVS and Kroger employees being the most pro-progressive.  \n\nFinally - if you are an employee at Kroger - you have to wonder if you are working at the right place.  Employees strongly support Democrats, while the company strongly supports Republicans.  ",
  "Supermarkets": "With supermarkets, you likely don't have a lot of choice depending on where you live.  Based on regional voting patterns it isn't surprising that there is a wide range of political giving.  ",
  "Glasses": "Luxottica is the dominant brand in the eyewear business.  And they aren't a bad choice.  Warby Parker and ACLens are great options if you are looking for smaller brands that are extremely supportive of Democrats.",
  "Home and Garden": "The big story in this category is the EXTREME pro-Republican slant of Home Depot and Lowe's.  You're likely to have much more success shopping other brands in this category.",
  "Cosmetics": "Is anyone surprised that Mary Kay and Amway are EXTREME Republican contributors?  Otherwise you are generally safe to shop your values in this category.",
  "Skin Care": "Est\u00e9e Lauder is the safe choice with skin care.  ",
  "Luggage": "Luggage is an easy category to shop your values!",
  "Jewelry": "As long as you avoid Ashford and Jewelry TV, the jewelry category is a safe one to shop your values.",
  "Telecom": "Telecom is a tough category to shop your values.  None of the major carriers are particularly good.  See the full analysis and choose with care.",
  "Banks": "Amalgamated, Beneficial and Aspiration Banks stand out in a category dominated by banks that almost exclusively support Republicans.",
  "Credit Cards": "Mastercard and Visa - always neck and neck...",

  "Insurance - Life": "It's hard to shop your values when buying Life Insurance.  ",

  "Kids' Toys": "Kid's Toys is an easy category to support your values.",
  "Kids' Clothing": "It's hard to support your values when buying kids clothers.  Avoid the kid specialists and look towards department stores as a better way to support your values.",
